# nsync-fs
Coming soon...

## Development
This module is written in coffeescript, if you are going to develop with it locally, you will need to transpile, which has been wrapped in the default `gulp` task:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/learn-co/nsync-fs
$ cd nsync-fs
$ npm install
$ gulp
$ npm link
```
